# Mathematical Modeling

Team-based Final Project for Math 142 at UCLA during Fall 2023:

Our final project for Math 142 is based on one research paper with the name: A mathematical model of “Gone with the Wind” (Rinaldi et al.). In the original paper, the authors extracted twelve scenes from the film “Gone with the Wind” to derive the mathematical model for analyzing the love dynamics between the two main characters of the movie, Scarlett O’Hara and Rhett Butler. Due to significant omissions in the movie plot and simplicity of the parameters set-ups, we believe that the original mathematical model developed by the authors is not accurate enough and can not represent the interactions between the main characters thoroughly. Therefore, we incorporate supplementary movie plots, add additional parameters, and adjust parameters in the original model to derive and support a new love mathematical model that is more comprehensive and fits the love evolution better.
